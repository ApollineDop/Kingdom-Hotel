		<h2>How can you travel all the way to the past ?</h2>
		<p>
		We know that time traveling is yet to be created. But what if we tell you that, staying in 2022, we can make you feel like you have travelled back in time to the renaissance?
		</p>
		<p>
		I always wondered what it was like to live during the renaissance, to live in big dresses, to go to balls, to learn to dance the waltz... So I thought of a way to fulfill this dream. That's when the Kingdom Castle house was created.
		</p>
		<p>
		Thanks to our hotels, you will be able to experience unique moments and to completely immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the renaissance. During the day you will learn traditional dances, go to great balls in the evening and have the opportunity to eat period meals!
		</p>

		<h2>You can come back!</h2>
		<p>If you already experienced a travel in the past and want to do it again, don't worry, you won't live the same experience!</p>
		<p>We often offer new things, and new activities, to find out about these new things, click on this link and fill in the form! </p>
